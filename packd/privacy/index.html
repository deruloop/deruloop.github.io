            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 20/12/2024</p>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 20/12/2024</p>
            <p>Thank you for using <strong>Packd</strong>! This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when using our app. We prioritize your privacy and aim to ensure transparency in how your information is processed.</p>
        
            <h3>1. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
            <p>Packd does not collect or store your personal information on our servers. All personal data is securely managed through <strong>Apple’s iCloud</strong> or handled locally on your device.</p>
        
            <h4>1.1 Packing Lists and Trip Data</h4>
            <p>- All your packing lists, trip information, and customizations are stored in iCloud.</p>
            <p>- We do not have direct access to this data, as it is managed entirely by Apple’s iCloud services, which comply with their <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        
            <h4>1.2 Location Information</h4>
            <p>- Packd does not access or store your location data.</p>
            <p>- Weather updates and map instructions are based on generic map pin addresses manually provided by you. These addresses are not linked to any geolocation services and are not stored or shared by Packd.</p>
        
            <h4>1.3 Interaction with OpenAI (ChatGPT Integration)</h4>
            <p>- For features such as AI-powered packing recommendations, Packd uses OpenAI APIs. Your prompts and responses are sent directly to OpenAI servers via a shared API key.</p>
            <p>- Packd does not log or access the content of your prompts or the AI-generated responses. OpenAI handles these interactions in accordance with their <a href="https://openai.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        
            <h3>2. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>We do not share your personal data with any third parties.</p>
            <p>The services Packd relies on (e.g., iCloud and OpenAI) manage data independently and follow their respective privacy policies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>iCloud:</strong> Ensures secure storage and synchronization of your data across your devices.</li>
                <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Handles AI-generated interactions without linking them to specific users.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>3. Security</h3>
            <p>We rely on Apple and OpenAI’s established security protocols to protect your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>iCloud Security:</strong> Your data is encrypted and managed by Apple, ensuring that only you have access.</li>
                <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Prompts are processed securely, and Packd has no insight into individual queries.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>4. User Rights</h3>
            <p>As your data is not stored or processed by Packd, any requests regarding data access or deletion must be directed to the relevant service provider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For iCloud Data:</strong> Manage your data via your Apple ID account settings.</li>
                <li><strong>For OpenAI Interactions:</strong> OpenAI processes prompts anonymously and does not link them to individual users.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
            <p>Packd does not use cookies or tracking technologies. If you use our website, basic analytics may be gathered by your browser or hosting provider but not processed by us.</p>
